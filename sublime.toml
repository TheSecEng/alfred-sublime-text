# How many directories deep to search by default.
# 0 = the path itself
# 1 = immediate children of the path
# 2 = grandchildren of the path
# etc.
# default: 2
#
# depth = 2

# How long to cache the list of projects for.
#Â default: 5m
#
# cache-age = "5m"

# Each search path is specified by a [[paths]] header and
# requires a path value.
# E.g.:
#
#  [[paths]]
#  path = "~/Dropbox"
#
# You can override the default depth:
#
#
#  [[paths]]
#  path = "~/Code"
#  depth = 3
